 * the displaced block to the C-block's *next* connection (i.e. after the
 * C-block), leaving the C-block's "mouth" empty.  Scratch expects the
 * displaced block to be placed *inside* the C-block (wrap behaviour).
 *
 * We fix this by patching `Connection.getConnectionForOrphanedConnection` so
 * that it prefers an available statement-input connection on the dragging block
 * over the last-next-in-stack connection when the orphan is a statement block.
 * This applies to both real blocks and insertion markers (drag previews) so
 * that the preview matches the actual drop result.

/**
 * When a drag preview (insertion marker) is cleaned up, Blockly calls
 * `marker.unplug(true)` which heals the stack by reconnecting the block before
 * the marker to whatever block was after it (via `marker.nextConnection`).
 *
 * Because we now send the displaced block (B2) into the insertion marker's
 * statement input for a correct visual preview, B2 is no longer at
 * `marker.nextConnection` when cleanup runs.  The heal step therefore skips B2
 * and it gets lost when the marker is disposed.
 *
 * We fix this by patching `hideInsertionMarker` to restore B2 from the
 * marker's statement input back to `marker.nextConnection` before the original
 * cleanup runs, so the standard healing logic reconnects B1.next → B2.
